## Common questions about the game
 1. The free space is intentionally un-marked to start.
    Our bingo game counts the free space whether you mark it or not, so have fun daubing! ðŸ–ŒðŸŽ¨
 1. Being able to mark something more than once is intentional. Daubing something for a fourth time will un-daubâ„¢  it, so don't worry if you daub something by mistake!
